summary: "Use the solution of a crossword puzzle as a word lookup to find a code."

The crossword lookup is a 2-part puzzle. In the first part the players
solve a crossword puzzle. The crossword puzzle should be easy because
really it is just a distraction. In the second part, the players have to
realize that the words in the crossword answers match a sequence of objects
or words elsewhere in the room. The players can then replace the words with
the number of the word in the crossword to get a number code. (This is much
like the [code-word lookup] puzzle except the word lookup is less obvious.

Here is an example of how this puzzle might work. We could start with
providing this crossword.

Players need to solve this puzzle. Here is the completed crossword.

Again, the crossword should be easy to complete. You can provide some
answers before you start to help.

At first, solving the crossword does not seem to have helped. But, the
second part of the puzzle is a sequence of items. For example, this shelf
of animal figurines.

On this shelf are 4 animals in the following order: dolphin, rabbit,
dragon, and seal. The trick is to recognize that these words are also in
the crossword. As with any crossword, each word has an associated number
associated with it. In this case, dolphin is clue 3, rabbit is clue 1,
dragon is clue 2, and seal is clue 6. Doing the word-number substitution we
get the code 3126, which can be used on a combination lock to open a box or
room.

Note that you will probably need to create your own crossword to implement
this puzzle with words that match what you are matching them to. Because
the crossword is meant to be simple, creating it should also be simple. To
help, you should be able to find several sites to create a puzzle from
words that you provide with a simple internet search.
