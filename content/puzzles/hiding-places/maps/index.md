summary: "Provide a map of the room to find a well hidden object."

In this puzzle, an important object is hidden somewhere players are [not
expected find]. To find the object, players first need to get a map that
will lead them to the correct place.

The map is of the escape room that the players are in. The map does not
have to be detailed, but it should have enough landmarks for players to
orient the map and find the location it is pointing to. Here is a simple
map I once used to lead players to find a key hidden in the window drapes.
