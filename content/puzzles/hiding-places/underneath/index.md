summary: "Hide a clue underneath an easy to move object."
---

A simple hiding place is a message underneath another object. The object
can be a simple prop such as a plate or cup. For example, your escape room
might have this normal place setting.

The players are expected to search around for clues. Simply lifting up the
objects reveals a hidden clue.

This is a simple puzzle that encourages players to interact with the
objects in the room. Players usually find the clue simply by picking up and
examining objects. The clue gets revealed secondhand as players move things
around.

The hiding place works best when hidden underneath a prop that is not
otherwise needed. The prop should be easy to move and is easy to handle.
