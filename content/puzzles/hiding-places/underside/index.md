summary: "Stick a clue to the bottom of an object."
---

Place a clue on the bottom side of an object. This puzzle works similarly
to placing a clue [underneath] an object except that the clue is stuck to
the underside.

The fun part about this puzzle is that sometimes players will pick up an
object to look underneath it, but miss the note that is stuck to the
underside.

In the example from the previous puzzle, the players might check underneath
the plates in a place setting, but find nothing.

The players may check several times before looking at the bottom of the
plate where the real clue is.
