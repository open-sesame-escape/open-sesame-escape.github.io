summary: "A sheet of paper must be folded backwards to line up a QR code."
---

This QR construction involves a single piece of paper. It has half of a QR
code on each side and (optionally) a QR code in the middle.

The middle (full) QR is a decoy. If players scan it, it just leads to a
[red herring].

The real clue is the other QR code, which is divided in half and placed at
opposite ends of the paper. The left half of the QR code is on the right
side of the paper and the right side of the QR is on the left side of the
image.

To solve the puzzle, players must fold the page backward to bring the two
ends together on the opposite side.

On the other side, players must line up the edges of the QR code.

To make the QR alignment possible, the ends of the paper need to be trimmed
right to the QR code. Also note that to make the code work players need to
be precise about the alignment. Thus, make sure there are enough cues (like
the bounding box shown here) to get the alignment correct.
