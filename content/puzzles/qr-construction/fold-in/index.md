This puzzle presents the players with a piece of paper with pieces of QR
code printed on it. The codes cannot be properly scanned on the flat paper.

The trick is to fold the paper to bring the pieces of QR code together. I
suggest using a simple fold reminiscent of [Mad Fold-Ins] (also known as
an [origami pleat fold]).

Creating a fold-in image is not difficult. Simply cut the image in half and
separate the two pieces by some distance perpendicular to the cut.

The folds have to be pretty precise to be [properly scanned]. To help, you
can provide a little overlap in the QR pieces and guiding lines on where to
fold and align the two pieces.

Figuring out and doing one fold is pretty easy. If you want to add an extra
challenge, you can make a second fold in a different direction. This can be
done by cutting the image for a fold in one direction, and then treating
the entire result as an image and cut in a different direction. (Note that
the players will have to fold in the opposite order you cut the images to
create it.)

Here is an example that requires a horizontal fold and then a little more
tricky diagonal fold.
