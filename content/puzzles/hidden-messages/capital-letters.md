summary: "The capital letters in the message don't follow grammar. That's
because they spell out a secret."

Instead of [highlighting letters](/puzzles/hidden-messages/highlight-letters)
using a change in font, another way to hide a message in a note is to use
capitol letters.

The note is fairly normal, but the capitol letters do not follow correct
grammar rules. Instead, the entire message is in lowercase except capitol
letters that spell out the secret message.
