An engaging story for an escape room will have the players working together
to overcome an imperative adversity. This might involve defeating a
particular person or beast. This hanging boss provides a method to reveal
and then defeat the "boss."

### Game Play

The hanging boss starts mounted on the ceiling. It should be unrecognizable
and out of reach. If players try to interact with it directly, remind them
not to pull things off the ceiling.

The hanging boss actually serves the function of two [boxes], each with its
own puzzle and each revealed with a lock on a [hook pulley]. The first lock
drops the tail end of the boss. The boss will become unfurled and hang from
a second string from the ceiling. The boss can be a figurine (such as a
Halloween decoration), a cardboard cutout, or some other physical
representation.

When the boss is revealed, a clue is also presented. It could be an item
dropped when the tail of the boss is lowered, or it could be written on the
boss so that it is only visible once the boss is revealed.

The second and final lock on a second [hook pulley] drops the entire boss
to the floor, signifying its defeat. Now that the boss is on the floor, the
players can access a clue mounted to the top.

### Setup

The setup of the hanging boss is done in the reverse order that it is
solved. Its head is first hung in place, and then the bottom is pulled up
to the ceiling.

The first step is to mount the contents of the second ["box"] on the boss's
head. An easy way to do this is to punch a hole in an envelope and place
the clue(s) inside of the envelope. Feed a string through the hole in the
envelope and tie it to the boss's head.

From here, loop the string around a [hook pulley] in the ceiling and
suspend the boss by connecting the other end of the string to a fixed
object in the room through a padlock. (See the [hook pulley] puzzle for
more details on setting up the figure so that it can be dropped once the
padlock is opened.)

Once the boss is hanging in place, tie a second string to the bottom of it.
If the boss is made of fabric, it can help to attach a safety pin to the
fabric and tie the string to the pin. Then, feed the string through a [hook
pulley], pull the entire boss up to the ceiling. Mount it to a fixed object
through a second padlock. Make sure the strings for the head and tail do
not get tangled with each other. Once the boss is in place, place any items
for the first ["box"] on top or rolled inside. They should stay in place
until the tail is dropped, at which time the items should fall to the
floor.
