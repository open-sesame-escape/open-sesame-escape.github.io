summary: "The grooves in blocks don't seem to align, until you stack them."
---

This puzzle starts with a collection of blocks. The blocks have some
grooves cut into opposing ends.

Players will probably quickly realize that although there are several
different patterns, some of the patterns line up. Players will probably try
to line up the blocks to make the grooves continuous, but this will not
work for more than a pair of blocks.

The trick to this puzzle is that the blocks need to be stacked vertically
rather than arranged horizontally. When stacked, the groove patterns can be
matched up. More importantly, the holes formed by the grooves form a
pattern of numbers.

Looking at the side of the blocks, the code is 8347.

This code was chosen because it results in a different groove pattern
between each pair of blocks, and none of the patterns are palindromes. This
means that there is only one way to arrange the blocks where all the
patterns match. Also, viewing the numbers upside down or inverted does not
show all proper numbers, so there is only one way to interpret the numbers
from the side.

Solving the groovy blocks puzzle can be tricky and might take the players
some time. I recommend providing the groovy blocks well before their code
is used so that the players have other puzzles to work on while they figure
this out.

The groovy blocks in the examples above were created with a [3D printer].
If you have a 3D printer, you can use [this STL file].

If you don't have a 3D printer, there are other ways to make matching
grooves. One way is to use a table saw if you have one. Cut up a 2x4 into
equal blocks of an appropriate length. Then set the blade low so that the
wood can be passed over the blade to cut a groove but not all the way
through the wood. Set the fence to guide a block to cut the groove the
appropriate distance from the end of a block. Keep the fence in place to
cut each groove that matches opposing blocks.

You can use [this pattern] to guide the placement of the fence and where to
cut the blocks.

If you don't have a way to make precise grooves in blocks, an alternate
approach would be to draw lines instead of grooves. Use a square tool and a
pen to draw lines perpendicular to the edge of the block. Hold two blocks
together to make sure that the lines match up. Make sure the lines spill
over the edges so that the locations, and hence numbers, can be seen when
the blocks are stacked correctly.
