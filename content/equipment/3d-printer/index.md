To be clear, you do _not_ need a 3D printer to create an escape room.
Although there are many affordable options, 3D printing is a hobby onto
itself.

If you happen to have access to a 3D printer, it can be helpful to
fabricate items as you need them, which can make life easier. If you have
one, you will probably use it. But if you don't, it will still be possible
to find, buy, construct, or jury-rig everything you need for a great at
home escape room.

One particularly useful thing I have found to print are [latches that can
be used with padlocks]. It is convenient to scale and print these to the
type of padlocks you have and then glue them to makeshift containers like
cardboard boxes. Again, you don't need a 3D printer to create these. You
can probably find something similar at your hardware store or just
improvise by wrapping [string] around the box connected with the lock. But
if you have the printer, it can simplify things.
