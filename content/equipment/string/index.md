It is always good to have some string on hand when setting up your escape
room. Your escape room will almost certainly require some amount of
juryrigging, and some type of string or rope will probably be required.

One of the most common needs for string is attaching [locks] to something
that needs to be locked. Chances are, the doors in your room do not have a
convenient, settable combination lock. So, you will probably have to attach
a padlock of the appropriate type, which will probably involve attaching a
string to the knob or across the door. Likewise, some of your containers
may not have convenient attachement points for locks, so string can often
be used to force an attachment.

When using string, you may want to tell players as part of the rules that
they are not to untie strings. None of the puzzles will involve untying
knots.
